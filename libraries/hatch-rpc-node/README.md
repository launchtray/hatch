# hatch-rpc-node
This project is a TypeScript library that provides remote procedure call (RPC) utilities
for node-based projects. It includes RPC transport implementations (which can be used by
classes in `hatch-rpc`) for worker threads and child processes, as well as higher-level
utilities for sending a ReadableStream across an RPC interface.
