# This file can be used to add additional paths that use OpenAPI features that (e.g.) might not be supported by Spot
# Note that the extension is YAML, but that YAML is a superset of JSON. In the case of conflicts with the Spot spec,
# this file will override values in the Spot file, unless the build scripts in package.json are modified to change the
